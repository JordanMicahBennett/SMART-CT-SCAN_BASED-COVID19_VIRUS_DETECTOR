# SMART-SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR
The aim is to develop a quick way to detect the nCov 2019 (Coronavirus 2019/2020, also called "Covid-19") strain, with the plan to use artificial neural networks or other machine learning model types.

This project began on January 29, 2020, [here](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CORONA_VIRUS_DETECTOR).

# WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) WARNING
[Coronavirus: Whole world 'must take action', warns WHO](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51299195)  
[Update Jan 31, 2020/WHO declares the new coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov))
   * WHO's warning should reasonably have come about a week earlier, [as advised about a week ago via Chris Martenson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk5P_iRYwTY), who I also refer to below regarding his 115 million nCov case prediction count.
   * **Update February 7, 2020**: [Artificial Intelligence Prediction: In 45 days, ~2.5 billion to be infected, ~52 million of which may die.](https://www.facebook.com/ProgrammingGodJordan/posts/879754635816897). See also [this detailed forbes report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/02/05/ai-predicts-coronavirus-could-infect-25b-and-kill-53m-doctors-say-thats-not-credible-and-heres-why/#96189011cd0d).

# WHY?

* The nCov 2019 (Coronavirus Strain 2019/2020) is spreading rapidly, with a [mortality rate between 2% and 4%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).  
    * By comparison, the common flu with a **far lower mortality rate of .1%**, [kills 291,000 to 646,000](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=208914) per year.
    * Things get worse; nCov spreads at ~tripple the transmission rate of the common flu. 
       * Common flu RO = 1.28 ([Estimated, transmission rate](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480))
       * nCov RO = 2.5 to 3.8 ([Estimated transmission rate](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-new-wuhan-coronavirus-stacks-up-against-sars-mers))
            * Recent nCov RO estimate [~4.08](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018952v1)!
* Current diagnosis methods may miss the presence of the virus due to [faulty dna based comparison methods, where multiple negative test results may occur before positive results are gained.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51491763)
* This ai driven method will reasonably help to **stop** [the exponential growth](http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/cherry/200126) of the nCov strain. 
    * 1 more month of exponential nCov growth = [~ 115 million cases, (of which ~ 23 million are potentially life threatening ones)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq3Y9rmlEQE) according to [an epidemiologist/PhD pathologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Martenson).


# CALL FOR CONTRIBUTION

[CT Scan based diagnostic by human radiologists, have outpaced dna testing, and had lent to China's report of ~15,000 cases overnight.](https://www.auntminnie.com/index.aspx?sec=sup&sub=cto&pag=dis&itemId=128140) 
* By extension, apart from human radiologist detection, perhaps an ai based image detection solution can speed up diagnosis, and help to replace the [faulty dna based comparison phase](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51491763). I've requested CT image data from a scientist involved with [manual diagnosis using CT scan data](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/radiol.2020200274).
